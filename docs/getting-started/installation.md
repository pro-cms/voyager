# Installation

## Require the Package

After creating your new Laravel application you can include the Voyager package with the following command:

```
composer require voyager-admin/voyager:"2.x-dev@dev"
```

## Run The Installer

Now we are ready to install Voyager. To do so, run

```
php artisan voyager:install
```

And that's it. You can now go to `http://[YOUR URL]/admin` and login with any existing user.
